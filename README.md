# Daedalus
A modloader for [Icarus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/) for blueprint and
C++ based mods. Still heavily under construction, see below for proper accredidation and info.

# Credit
This project was originally a fork of an old version of 
[SatisfactoryModLoader](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader) but has since
transitioned to using a fork of [UnrealModLoader](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader).

Most credit should go to [RusselJerome](https://github.com/RussellJerome) for his UnrealModLoader project
(seriously awesome software), and the amazing reverse engineers behind [UnrealDumper](https://github.com/guttir14/UnrealDumper-4.25)
who have made profiles for which I've pulled offsets.
