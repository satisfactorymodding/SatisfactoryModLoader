/**
* The replication detail actor is an extendable class for handling special cases of replication for buildables.
* This class is mostly needed becase it is not possible to dynamically change the replication state of components 
* without having them replicate at least once. With this structure, replication data can be moved to a separate actor
* so that the main actor can still be dynamic while the replicated components and values can be dormant until needed.
*
* E.g. inventory stacks don't need to be replicated until a player interacts with the building.
