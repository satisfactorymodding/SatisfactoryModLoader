/**
 * A pole based used for making stacking supported between types.
//@TODO:[DavalliusA:Fri/14-02-2020]   I would like to move over more stuff from poles and pipe supports here, as they share so many things, but they have named them
a bitt differently for no real reason, and it's a bit scary to do that without proper testing and time to adjust. 
So we'll not  do that now. But one day we should probably unify a good base here.
