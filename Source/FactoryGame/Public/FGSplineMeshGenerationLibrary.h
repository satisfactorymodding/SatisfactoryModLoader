	 * Given a spline, this creates non-instanced spline meshes along the spline.
	 *
	 * @param spline			The spline the meshes should go along.
	 *
	 * @oaram maxSplineLengthToFill		The lenght of the spline to fill with meshes, any distance after this will be left without meshes.
	 * 									This can be more than the spline length (in which case spline length is used)
	 * 									If this is 0 or less, no meshes will be generated.
	 *
	 * @param mesh				The static mesh to spline, it will be splined along the X-axis.
	 *
	 * @param meshLength		The length of the given mesh, along it's X-axis.
	 *
	 * @param meshPool			Mesh pool to use for the created spline meshes, new meshes are created
	 *							as needed and old meshes are removed if there are too many in a reused pool.
	 *							Pools can be reused and the meshes will be re-splined to fix the current need,
	 *							This is useful for holograms as the spline change around a lot.
	 *
	 * @param meshConstructor	Lambda or other function that creates a new mesh to put in the pool.
	 * 							This is only called when a new mesh needs to be created in the pool,
	 * 							This means that if the number of meshes needed remains constant this
	 * 							is only called the first time the function is called.
	 *							The constructor is responsible for calling SetupAttachment and set the Owner.
	 *							The constructor must never call RegisterComponent.
	 *							If the returned mesh have mobility Static, then the pool cannot be reused as any further changes to the mesh have no effect.
	 *
	 *							Example:
	 *							[]( USplineComponent* spline )
	 *							{
	 *								USplineMeshComponent* newComponent = NewObject< USplineMeshComponent >( spline->GetOwner(), USplineMeshComponent::StaticClass() );
	 *
	 *								newComponent->SetupAttachment( spline );
	 *								newComponent->Mobility = EComponentMobility::Movable;
	 *
	 *								// Custom initialization steps
	 *
	 *								return newComponent;
	 *							}
